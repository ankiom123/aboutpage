            <p>Mr. YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, fondly known as Jagan to millions of Telugus in AP and elsewhere in the world, is a young politician of iron will coupled with an irrefutable commitment to the edifice of his father’s legacy and the principles of welfare state as focused and enunciated by YSR.
                Not the one to be ever confronted by a Hamlet’s dilemma, the 39-year old untiring leader thoroughly believes in fast decision making for finding solutions to nagging issues and is always guided by a clear set of ideas and ideals on issues confronting the AP state.

                Determined as he was to move on with his Odarpu Yatra to console the families of those who gave up their lives after the sudden and tragic demise of YSR in 2009, YS Jagan Mohan Reddy quit the Congress when the party bosses in Delhi ordered him not to go ahead with it.

                YS Jagan Mohan Reddy launched the YSRCP with people’s support and then went ahead with his Odarpu Yatra to keep the promises he made to the families.

                The same determination made him launch the YSR Congress Party as part of his unflinching efforts to pick up the political gauntlet from where his father left and serve the masses with the same zeal and enthusiasm exhibited by his father.

                YS Jagan Mohan Reddy fired his first salvo in state politics by vigorously campaigning on behalf of the Congress party in 2009 elections and proved himself to be on par with his father in attracting crowds. This little but rich experience helped him undertake Odarpu Yatra in several phases over a period of two and a half years and move closer to the people across the state.

                His vigorous Odarpu Yatra schedules helped him establish his credentials as a strong political leader in the state and also as a credible alternative to the late YS Rajashekar Reddy.

                YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is the only political leader in the state to have visited thousands of towns and villages in a short period to study the people’s problems as part of his Odarpu Yatra and evolve ways and means to find permanent solutions.</p>
